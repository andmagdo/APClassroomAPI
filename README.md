# APClassroomAPI
A Python api for AP Classroom


Note that many features will only work for student accounts, as I do not have a teacher account to test with.


I am using this as my AP CSP project. Although it allows collaberation, I would not like to try that, the attribution will be odd.


## Currently NOT working -- CBLogin/JwtToken still needs to be grabbed
